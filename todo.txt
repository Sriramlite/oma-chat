Prompt:
Design and develop a modern Online Messaging Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js serverless functions for the backend, deployed on Vercel.

The application should support secure user authentication, real-time messaging, media sharing, and advanced UI interactions such as predictive feedback animations. The system must be scalable, responsive, and optimized for both web and mobile devices.

The backend should expose RESTful APIs for authentication, messaging, user management, and notifications, while the frontend should provide a clean, intuitive user experience with smooth animations, dark mode, and accessibility support.

The project should demonstrate modern full-stack development practices, cloud deployment, and real-world messaging app features suitable for professional and academic evaluation.
